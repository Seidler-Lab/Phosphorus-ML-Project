Not in this GitHub Repo are 3 data folders:
1. Hyak/
2. Cascade/
3. ProcessedData/

The Hyak and Cascade folders each have an XES and XANES subdirectory to put .dat files from their respective supercomputers.

The ProcessedData folder is where processed spectrum files go after the Dat_to_Spectra jupyter notebook. Each compound is organized by CID in this directory.
